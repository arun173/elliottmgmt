# elliottmgmt

**Challenge:**

1. Retrieve up to date SSL scan results for www.elliottmgmt.com from Qualys SSL Labs API documentation is available at (https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/stable/ssllabs-api-docs.md)
2. Format relevant information into a report ready for email distribution.

**Solution:**

To get the SSL scan results for a domain SSL LABS provide an API interface to run a free scan and to retrieve those results.
Reference: https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs-v3.md
For this solution SSL LABS API V3 is being used.

**Scripting Language used: Python V3.12.2**

This script should be compatible with any Python V3 version however it is testing only with V3.12.2 since that's what I have in my dev machine.

**High Level Design**
